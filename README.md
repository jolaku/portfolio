# portfolio
My portfolio includes projects confirming my skills in the field of Data Science.
The project I'm currently working on is "titanic-survival-prediction."
This is the way I'm checking my skills, which I'm learning during the Data Science course organized by PFIG.
The "titanic-survival-prediction" is still in progress. I'm creating it by myself, supported by the wonderful power of the internet and ChatGPT.
